This one was a few days late, and I still haven't finished day 5. This is partially because I'm getting busy with college finals, partially because I had some unexpected hiccups getting any code to run on the device for day 6, and also because I picked a rather extreme option for day 5. The next few days will probably continue to come in late, but ~~I still intend to complete everything before the 25th.~~ *Hello from the 26th! Let's just ignore what past me said here, yeah?*

Anyway, day 6 was run on the MIPS 24KEc in a Netgear WN3000RP v3 WiFi extender running OpenWrt Linux. Getting things to compile for this machine was a bit of an adventure that led me to commit acts of insanity such as patching `libc.a` with a hex editor, but that's irrelevant to the code which actually solves the puzzle.
