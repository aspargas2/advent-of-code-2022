Day 9 was completed in PowerPC assembly and built into an executable for the Nintendo Wii. Part 1 was run on a real Wii, and that output is [here](output_part1.jpg). Due to some unfortunate circumstances, I no longer had access to my Wii by the time I finished part 2, so I cheated and used Dolphin to get that solution: [output_cheating.jpg](output_cheating.jpg). I have no doubts that the finished code for solving both parts would have worked fine on real hardware too.
