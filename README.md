As a fun challenge for this year's [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), I decided to try solving each day's challenge in assembly for a different architecture, and obtaining that day's solution by running the code on a physical processor of that architecture. For each day that I solve, I will be uploading my code and details of what device it was run on here.

To be honest, I haven't given too much thought to the detailed rules of this challenge, but to start with I am loosely defining "different architecture" as "different first item in an LLVM target triple." This means I get to count armv4, v5, etc as all different architectures, which should make this significantly more possible for me. As I get into actually doing this, I may add additional stipulations or exceptions as necessary.

I doubt anyone else is crazy ~~and masochistic~~ enough to attempt this challenge with me, but if you do, I would love to see what devices you end up running everything on. In any case, good luck and have fun with AoC this year!
