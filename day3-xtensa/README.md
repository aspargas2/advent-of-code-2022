Day 3 was completed on an ESP8266MOD chip in an Arduino NodeMCU module. I'm not entirely sure of the proper name for the CPU in this thing, but the GNU binutils for it were prefixed with `xtensa-lx106-elf-` so that's what I'm going with. Unfortunately I didn't have time to do anything cute for the answer output this time, so it was simply grabbed from a serial terminal on my laptop.
