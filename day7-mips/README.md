Day 7 was completed on the Broadcom BMIPS4350 in an old Verizon-branded DSL modem-router (model number GT784WNV) running OpenWrt Linux. I guess it's kinda lame of me to do two days in row both in MIPS and both on networky things running OpenWrt, but this one was big ~~girl~~ endian MIPS so it's definitely within the rules, and I had to fight even harder with libc to get anything to run on this one and ended up giving up and using `-nostdlib`, so I guess that struggle is what I get for being a bit lame.
